Here's a basic Photo Gallery structure built in Python/Django with the support of the following functionalities:
- User authentication (the Gallery contents can only be accessed by the authorized users);
- Image upload in line with the User profile in the back-end;
- Image validation on upload & based on the upload limit file size;
- Displaying some custom error messages in the back-end for the info purposes;
- Contact form functionality for the registered users;

The front-end is supported by Bootstrap & some pre-defined template for the sake of quick implementation, the DB relies on PostgreSQL. 
Additional features shall be added upon availability.
